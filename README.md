# AES-256
Encryption/Decryption of Local Files Employing AES-256 Algorithm<br />
Written in C & Python (Python files haven't been added yet!)<br />

## How to use:
### For C:
First, you need to compile the files. It should be noted that the header and main files must be in the same directory. Then, run the output file.<br />
In Linux, you should first run:<br />
``` markdown
gcc main.c
```
Then, run:
``` markdown
./a.out
```
### For Python:
Files will be added soon!
In your terminal, CMD, or Powershell run:
``` markdown
python AES.py
```
